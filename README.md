# DoDo
## What is this?
If you want to know why **DoDo** was created, you have to red following story: I was looking for a simple "ToDo"
application on Google's Play store but I did not find any that behaved and looked like one I wanted to use. So I decided
to create one on my own. This repository represents that application and I ended up with the idea naming it "DoDo".
## What does it do?
Work in progress
